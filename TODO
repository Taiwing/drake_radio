- create a timescale (check the galaxy and universe lifetime)
- add a time slider to go forward or backward in time (maybe add 'stops' for
  events, like when a civilisation appears or disappears or a meeting happens)
- add a speed parameter for the simulation
- make the alien civilisations appear and disappear depending on the equation
  parameters and result
- illustrate this with 'signal bubbles'
- add stats for events, number of living civilisations, dead civilisations,
  detection count (when a civilisation detects an other), contact count (when
  civilisations can actually communicate with each other, meaning sending a
  signal to a civilisation and receiving a response) and duration (how long
  contact is possible between the two civilisations), and averages for these
  values

- expand README file explanations
