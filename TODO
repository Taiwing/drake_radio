- add a timer and a maybe a speed meter
- add stats for events, number of living civilisations, dead civilisations,
  detection count (when a civilisation detects an other), contact count (when
  civilisations can actually communicate with each other, meaning sending a
  signal to a civilisation and receiving a response) and duration (how long
  contact is possible between the two civilisations), and averages for these
  values (add 'animations' for these events)

- expand README file explanations
- add a documentation page (about how the simulation works, what the bubbles and
  animation precisely represent, etc...)

MAYBE:

- make it possible to disable signal bubbles (do it by default for optimistic
  presets where there are many long-lasting civlizations, as said below,
  detection and contact vectors might be enough at that point)
- generate Events in the Drake Simulation function (like 'birth', 'death',
  'detection', 'contact', etc...) and catch them to illustrate (then no need to
  actually send the lifetime when a Bubble is created, just send a death signal)
- Illustrate detections and contact events with vector lines between the
  corresponding stars (use different colors, or maybe make them simple then
  double arrows)
- Show civ birth and death by changing the star color (green for live and blue
  for dead ? maybe do the same for the Bubbles ?), and maybe also by adding a
  "light wave effect"

- add a scale for the distances (how to handle the zoom ?), or maybe just give
  the size info on an explication page
- not to be a stickler but if a civilization is not exactly at the center some
  stars might still be on the outside of the signal bubble when it disappears,
  maybe compute the actual radius needed (just add the distance from the origin
  point I think)
- refactor the drake file, separate dialog element and config initialization

FIX:

- Even on the reasonable preset the number of bubbles becomes overwhelming
  (at the center anyway). Maybe create a function that reduces bubble lifetimes
  when there is a lot of them around. Since the probability becomes bigger and
  bigger at the center diminish the radiusMax value depending on how close the
  bubble is the origin point. Make it possible to disable this function in the
  parameters menu.
- The conservative and pessimistic presets have the inverse problem. The
  simulation shows nothing. This makes sense because the preset speeds are so
  high that the bubbles exit the galaxy at the first tick. To see something
  (besides the stats), there would need be be effects on civ birth and death
  that have fixed duration (that do not depend on the speed parameter). Also
  maybe leave an 'artefact' representing the dead civilization (like a little
  sphere that would show for the use without having to zoom to the star
  particle).
- enforce max values and value types for drakeEquation and simulation parameters
- Come up with a "smart" truncating function for the floating point values in
  the drake form (for N and Ny). Because right now floating point imprecision
  absurdities are shown to the user and it is pretty ugly (takes all the space for
  no good reason anyway).
