- actually document the project in the README file

- create the 'base' civilisation (maybe add parameters for it, to place it
  wherever for example, or its lifespan and signal sending)
- create a timescale (check the universe lifetime)
- add a time slider to go forward or backward in time (maybe add 'stops' for
  events, like when a civilisation appears or disappears or a meeting happens)
- add a speed parameter for the simulation
- make the alien civilisations appear and disappear depending on the equation
  parameters and result
- illustrate this with 'signal bubbles'
