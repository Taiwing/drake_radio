- Efficiently compute detections in simulation (a civilization sees an other for
  the first time). If it cant be handled do it probabilistically (based on
  current N, average lifetime and galaxy dimensions). Maybe switch methods at a
  some point. Also show their stats.

- expand README file explanations
- add a documentation page (about how the simulation works, what the bubbles and
  animation precisely represent, etc...)

MAYBE:

- compute the following events in simulation (and show their stats):
  - contact: a signal is sent by Alice, detected by Bob which sends its own
    signal, that is then detected by Alice
  - dialog: is mutual contact (contact signal goes back to Bob)
- compute average detection/contact/dialog duration

- illustrate detections and contact events with vector lines between the
  corresponding stars (use different colors, or maybe make them simple then
  double arrows)
- create "death signal" bubbles if the "birth signal" bubble has burst (like
  blue for birth and red for death, when the signal is "leaving" the galaxy)

- A VERY VERY COOL FEATURE would be an automatic slow down on pessimistic
  configurations, so that the user can actually see something happening when
  it does. Like slow enough so that life and death bubbles woud be seen
  appearing and disappearing (like 10 seconds maybe ? depending on the lifetime
  parameter too). In order for this to work the extremely low probability events
  should be biased toward happening at the end of tick (like right at the end
  actually), so that the speed can be updated before the next tick. It could
  also happen for more optimistic configurations where some other events are
  really rare, like detection and contact. MAYBE also automatically move the
  camera to actually witness the event. Then speed up to the previous speed when
  the event is not visible anymore (except if the user has paused or changed
  speed in between).

- add a scale for the distances (how to handle the zoom ?), or maybe just give
  the size info on an explication page
- not to be a stickler but if a civilization is not exactly at the center some
  stars might still be on the outside of the signal bubble when it disappears,
  maybe compute the actual radius needed (just add the distance from the origin
  point I think)
- refactor the drake file, separate dialog element and config initialization
- refactor controls into control-panel element

FIX:

- enforce max values and value types for drakeEquation and simulation parameters
- Time value overflows. Depending on the speed the year count can easily reach
  into the billions. This value should be a BigInt.
