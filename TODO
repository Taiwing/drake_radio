STAR REFACTOR:
- Make it possible to disable global star cloud
- Create a separate "Simulation" Group for the Bubbles
- Pass a function hook to the Loop system that will still use the
  "drakeSimulation" function to play the simulation. It should return list of
  created civilizations with the star coordinates (maybe just the index actually
  so that I dont have to convert it from the light year system to ThreeJS), and
  individual lifetimes.

STAR REFACTOR MAYBE:
- generate Events in the Drake Simulation function (like 'birth', 'death',
  'detection', 'contact', etc...) and catch them to illustrate (then no need to
  actually send the lifetime when a Bubble is created, just send a death signal)
- Illustrate detections and contact events with vector lines between the
  corresponding stars (use different colors, or maybe make them simple then
  double arrows)
- Show civ birth and death by changing the star color (green for live and blue
  for dead ? maybe do the same for the Bubbles ?), and maybe also by adding a
  "light wave effect"

- add a recentering button (for when galaxy position has been messed around
  with)
- add a timer and a maybe a speed meter
- add stats for events, number of living civilisations, dead civilisations,
  detection count (when a civilisation detects an other), contact count (when
  civilisations can actually communicate with each other, meaning sending a
  signal to a civilisation and receiving a response) and duration (how long
  contact is possible between the two civilisations), and averages for these
  values (add 'animations' for these events)
- create drake equation presets (something like 'conservative', 'probable',
  'optimistic', 'star trek')

- expand README file explanations

MAYBE:

- add a global hard reset button (next to pause/play) that would remove every
  civilization and reset the drake equation
- add a scale for the distances (how to handle the zoom ?), or maybe just give
  the size info on an explication page
- not to be a stickler but if a civilization is not exactly at the center some
  stars might still be on the outside of the signal bubble when it disappears,
  maybe compute the actual radius needed (just add the distance from the origin
  point I think)

FIX:

- enforce max values and value types for drakeEquation and simulation parameters
