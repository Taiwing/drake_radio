- add a timer and a maybe a speed meter
- add stats for events, number of living civilisations, dead civilisations,
  detection count (when a civilisation detects an other), contact count (when
  civilisations can actually communicate with each other, meaning sending a
  signal to a civilisation and receiving a response) and duration (how long
  contact is possible between the two civilisations), and averages for these
  values (add 'animations' for these events)
- create drake equation presets (something like 'conservative', 'probable',
  'optimistic', 'star trek')

- expand README file explanations

MAYBE:

- refactor so that constants are all at the same place and are thus accesible
  everywhere (like the UNIT value which is used to build the galaxy but also
  needed for calculating distances between points)
- add a global reset button (next to pause/play) that would remove every
  civilization and reset the drake equation
- add a scale for the distances (how to handle the zoom ?), or maybe just give
  the size info on an explication page
- not to be a stickler but if a civilization is not exactly at the center some
  stars might still be on the outside of the signal bubble when it disappears,
  maybe compute the actual radius needed (just add the distance from the origin
  point I think)

FIX:

- enforce max values and value types for drakeEquation and simulation parameters
