- take delta and thickness into account when creating bubbles
- add a timer and a maybe a speed meter
- add stats for events, number of living civilisations, dead civilisations,
  detection count (when a civilisation detects an other), contact count (when
  civilisations can actually communicate with each other, meaning sending a
  signal to a civilisation and receiving a response) and duration (how long
  contact is possible between the two civilisations), and averages for these
  values (add 'animations' for these events)
- create drake equation presets (something like 'conservative', 'probable',
  'optimistic', 'star trek')
- make it possible to disable galactic rotation
- somewhat randomize civilisations lifetimes (maybe create a parameter in the
  simulation menu to add some 'noise' to this value)

- expand README file explanations

MAYBE:

- refactor so that constants are all at the same place and are thus accesible
  everywhere (like the UNIT value which is used to build the galaxy but also
  needed for calculating distances between points)

FIX:

- make it so the galactic center is at the center of the page
- enforce max values and value types for drakeEquation and simulation parameters
- disappearing galactic center inside signal bubbles
