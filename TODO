- make the alien civilisations appear and disappear depending on the equation
  parameters and result
- illustrate this with 'signal bubbles'
- add stats for events, number of living civilisations, dead civilisations,
  detection count (when a civilisation detects an other), contact count (when
  civilisations can actually communicate with each other, meaning sending a
  signal to a civilisation and receiving a response) and duration (how long
  contact is possible between the two civilisations), and averages for these
  values
- create drake equation presets (something like 'conservative', 'probable',
  'optimistic')

- expand README file explanations

FIX:

- make it so the galactic center is at the center of the page
- enforce max values for drakeEquation and simulation parameters
